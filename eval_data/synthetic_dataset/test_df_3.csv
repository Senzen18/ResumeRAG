Who You'll Work With
Cisco is the worldwide leader in networking that transforms how people connect, communicate, and collaborate. Since 1984, Cisco has led in the innovation of IP-based networking technologies such as routing, switching, security, unified communications, video, and wireless. Our responsible business practices help ensure business sustainability and environmentally conscious operations and products.
Participate on a project team of engineers involved in development of software for Cisco products. Requires use of a strong background in SW design, documentation and implementation, on projects that may include any of the following list of responsibilities:
What You'll Do
Align with and influence various stakeholders across the globe to evolve engineering best practices and ensure high-quality product releases.
Represent Cisco to customers and the rest of the industry in the development and deployment of the solutions.
Who You Are
Cisco Storage Area Networks team is looking for a Rockstar engineer to scale their analytics platform to the next level. If you are looking to challenge yourself and dirty your hands to build the next world-class analytics platform, here is your chance. Candidate should satisfy the following requirements:
Thorough understanding of messaging infrastructure like Kafka, Rabbitmq or other distributed messaging infrastructures
Deep understanding of any of the distributed databases like Elasticsearch, MongoDb, Dynamodb etc.
2+ years of experience building microservice based applications. Knowledge on Kubernetes is a plus
Should have built distributed applications from ground-up
Should have deep systems knowledge to understand performance bottlenecks and find solutions to scale up the architecture

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A block-chain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box! But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!","John Doe
